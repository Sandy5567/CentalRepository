External Merge and Diff Tools
Although Git has an internal implementation of diff, which is what we’ve been showing in this book, you can set up an external tool instead. You can also set up a graphical merge-conflict-resolution tool instead of having to resolve conflicts manually. We’ll demonstrate setting up the Perforce Visual Merge Tool (P4Merge) to do your diffs and merge resolutions, because it’s a nice graphical tool and it’s free.
If you want to try this out, P4Merge works on all major platforms, so you should be able to do so. We’ll use path names in the examples that work on macOS and Linux systems; for Windows, you’ll have to change /usr/local/bin to an executable path in your environment.

To begin, download P4Merge from Perforce. Next, you’ll set up external wrapper scripts to run your commands. We’ll use the macOS path for the executable; in other systems, it will be where your p4merge binary is installed. Set up a merge wrapper script named extMerge that calls your binary with all the arguments provided
